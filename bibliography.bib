  abstract = {Rare hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pools outside the bone marrow (BM) contribute to blood production in stress and disease but remain ill-defined. Although non-mobilized peripheral blood (PB) is routinely sampled for clinical management, the diagnosis and monitoring potential of PB HSPCs remains untapped, as no healthy PB HSPC baseline has been reported. Here we comprehensively delineate human extramedullary HSPC compartments comparing spleen, PB and mobilized PB (mPB) to BM using single-cell RNA-seq and/or functional assays. We uncover HSPC features shared by extramedullary tissues and others unique to PB. First, in contrast to actively dividing BM HSPCs, we find no evidence of substantial ongoing hematopoiesis in extramedullary tissues at steady state, but report increased splenic HSPC proliferative output during stress erythropoiesis. Second, extramedullary stem cells/multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) from spleen, PB and mPB share a common transcriptional signature and increased abundance of lineage-primed subsets compared to BM. Third, healthy PB HSPCs display a unique bias towards erythroid-megakaryocytic differentiation. At HSC/MPP level, this is functionally imparted by a subset of phenotypic CD71+ HSC/MPPs, exclusively producing erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, highly abundant in PB but rare in other adult tissues. Finally, the unique erythroid-megakaryocytic-skewing of PB is perturbed with age, in essential thrombocythemia and in beta-thalassemia. Collectively, we identify extramedullary lineage-primed HSPC reservoirs that are non-proliferative in situ and report involvement of splenic HSPCs during demand-adapted hematopoiesis. Our data also establish aberrant composition and function of circulating HSPCs as potential clinical indicators of BM dysfunction.}

title = "Omega: A General Formulation of the Rand Index of Cluster Recovery Suitable for Non-disjoint Solutions",
abstract = "Cluster recovery indices are more important than ever, because of the necessity for comparing the large number of clustering procedures available today. Of the cluster recovery indices prominent in contemporary literature, the Hubert and Arabie (1985) adjustment to the Rand index (1971) has been demonstrated to have the most desirable properties (Milligan & Cooper, 1986). However, use of the Hubert and Arabie adjustment to the Rand index is limited to cluster solutions involving non-overlapping, or disjoint, clusters. The present paper introduces a generalization of the Hubert and Arabie adjusted Rand index. This generalization, called the Omega index, can be applied to situations where both, one, or neither of the solutions being compared is non-disjoint. In the special case where both solutions are disjoint, the Omega index is equivalent to the Hubert and Arabie adjusted Rand index.",

To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied. Additionally, the database contains summarized information about analysis in the papers, allowing for analysis of trends in the field. As an example, we show that the number of cell types identified in scRNA-seq studies is proportional to the number of cells analysed.Database URL: www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies/gui}

Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset.

Graph clustering, also known as network community detection, is often performed by optimizing such a function. Two axioms tailored for graph clustering quality functions are introduced, and the four axioms introduced in previous work on distance based clustering are reformulated and generalized for the graph setting. We show that modularity, a standard quality function for graph clustering, does not satisfy all of these six properties. This motivates the derivation of a new family of quality functions, adaptive scale modularity, which does satisfy the proposed axioms. Adaptive scale modularity has two parameters, which give greater flexibility in the kinds of clusterings that can be found. Standard graph clustering quality functions, such as normalized cut and unnormalized cut, are obtained as special cases of adaptive scale modularity. In general, the results of our investigation indicate that the considered axiomatic framework covers existing `good' quality functions for graph clustering, and can be used to derive an interesting new family of quality functions.}

  abstract = {Modularity is a widely used quality measure for graph clusterings. Its exact maximization is NP-hard and prohibitively expensive for large graphs. Popular heuristics first perform a coarsening phase, where local search starting from singleton clusters is used to compute a preliminary clustering, and then optionally a refinement phase, where this clustering is improved by moving vertices between clusters. As a generalization, multilevel heuristics coarsen in several stages, and refine by moving entire clusters from each of these stages, not only individual vertices. This article organizes existing and new single-level and multilevel heuristics into a coherent design space, and compares them experimentally with respect to their effectiveness (achieved modularity) and runtime. For coarsening by iterated cluster joining, it turns out that the most widely used criterion for joining clusters (modularity increase) is outperformed by other simple criteria, that a recent multistep algorithm [Schuetz and Caflisch 2008] is no improvement over simple single-step coarsening for these criteria, and that the recent multilevel coarsening by iterated vertex moving [Blondel et al. 2008] is somewhat faster but slightly less effective (with refinement). The new multilevel refinement is significantly more effective than the conventional single-level refinement or no refinement, in reasonable runtime. A comparison with published benchmark results and algorithm implementations shows that multilevel local search heuristics, despite their relative simplicity, are competitive with the best algorithms in the literature.},

Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.}

The core of single-cell pipelines is partitioning cells and assigning cell-identities; extensive consequences derive from this step; generating robust and reproducible outputs is essential. From benchmarking established single-cell pipelines, we observed that clustering results critically depend on algorithmic choices (e.g. method, parameters) and technical details (e.g. random seeds).We present ClustAssess, a suite of tools for quantifying clustering robustness both within and across methods. The tools provide fine-grained information enabling (a) the detection of optimal number of clusters, (b) identification of regions of similarity (and divergence) across methods, (c) a data driven assessment of optimal parameter ranges. The aim is to assist practitioners in evaluating the robustness of cell-identity inference based on the partitioning, and provide information for choosing robust clustering methods and parameters.We illustrate its use on three case studies: a single-cell dataset of in-vivo hematopoietic stem and progenitors (10x Genomics scRNA-seq), in-vitro endoderm differentiation (SMART-seq), and multimodal in-vivo peripheral blood (10x RNA+ATAC). The additional checks offer novel viewpoints on clustering stability, and provide a framework for consistent decision-making on preprocessing, method choice, and parameters for clustering.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Biological functions emerge from complex and dynamic networks of protein–protein interactions. Because these protein–protein interaction networks, or interactomes, represent pairwise connections within a hierarchically organized system, it is often useful to identify higher-order associations embedded within them, such as multimember protein complexes. Graph-based clustering techniques are widely used to accomplish this goal, and dozens of field-specific and general clustering algorithms exist. However, interactomes can be prone to errors, especially when inferred from high-throughput biochemical assays. Therefore, robustness to network-level noise is an important criterion. Here, we tested the robustness of a range of graph-based clustering algorithms in the presence of noise, including algorithms common across domains and those specific to protein networks. Strikingly, we found that all of the clustering algorithms tested here markedly amplified network-level noise. Randomly rewiring only 1% of network edges yielded more than a 50% change in clustering results. Moreover, we found the impact of network noise on individual clusters was not uniform: some clusters were consistently robust to injected noise, whereas others were not. Therefore we developed the clust.perturb R package and Shiny web application to measure the reproducibility of clusters by randomly perturbing the network. We show that clust.perturb results are predictive of real-world cluster stability: poorly reproducible clusters as identified by clust.perturb are significantly less likely to be reclustered across experiments. We conclude that graph-based clustering amplifies noise in protein interaction networks, but quantifying the robustness of a cluster to network noise can separate stable protein complexes from spurious associations.}

  abstract = {Detecting communities in large networks has drawn much attention over the years. While modularity remains one of the more popular methods of community detection, the so-called resolution limit remains a significant drawback. To overcome this issue, it was recently suggested that instead of comparing the network to a random null model, as is done in modularity, it should be compared to a constant factor. However, it is unclear what is meant exactly by ``resolution-limit-free,'' that is, not suffering from the resolution limit. Furthermore, the question remains what other methods could be classified as resolution-limit-free. In this paper we suggest a rigorous definition and derive some basic properties of resolution-limit-free methods. More importantly, we are able to prove exactly which class of community detection methods are resolution-limit-free. Furthermore, we analyze which methods are not resolution-limit-free, suggesting there is only a limited scope for resolution-limit-free community detection methods. Finally, we provide such a natural formulation, and show it performs superbly.}

  abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is also used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular ``Louvain algorithm''. The computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the~literature.},

In particular, genome-wide single-cell measurements such as transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of cellular composition as well as functional variation in homogenic cell populations. An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that belong to the same cell types based on gene expression patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes).Results: In this article, we describe a novel algorithm named shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-Cliq that clusters single-cell transcriptomes. SNN-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling high-dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real experimental datasets, SNN-Cliq outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested. More importantly, the clustering results of SNN-Cliq reflect the cell types or origins with high accuracy.Availability and implementation: The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and Python.
