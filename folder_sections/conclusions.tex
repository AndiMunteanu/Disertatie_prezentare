    \begin{itemize}
        \item The time complexity of ECS calculation between two disjoint partitions has been improved from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(nm)$.
        \item The calculation of ECC is also improved by merging (almost) identical partitions and by using weights.
        \item The output of the clustering pipeline is affected by the change of random seed.
        \item We proposed a stability pipeline which provides visual tools to assess the robustness at the change of random seed of different configurations.
    \end{itemize}
