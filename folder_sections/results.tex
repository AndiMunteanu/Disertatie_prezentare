\subsection{ClustAssess vs Clusim - ECS benchmarks}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item To benchmark the performance of the \texttt{ClustAssess} package, we compare it to \texttt{Clusim}. 
        \item \texttt{Clusim} is a Python package that contains the official implementation from the authors of the ECS paper \cite{Gates2019b}.
        \item In \texttt{Clusim}, the ECS between two disjoint partitions is determined based on the affinity matrices.
        \item The benchmark relies on the ECS between two fixed partitions using the implementations from \texttt{ClustAssess} and \texttt{Clusim}. The size of the partitions varies from 50 to 90 000. The number of clusters is set to 20 for both partitions. The assessment is repeated 30 times.

           \texttt{ClustAssess} requires less than a second to calculate the ECS, while the execution time of \texttt{Clusim} increases exponentially.

            % The experiment was repeated to evaluate the memory required by each package to perform the calculation.

            For the optimized version from \texttt{ClustAssess} the data storage scales proportionally to the number of clusters.

           The storage of the whole affinity matrix in \texttt{Clusim} is inefficient, reaching a memory allocation of 241 GiBs for the largest dataset.

\begin{frame}{Performance with varying number of clusters}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The time complexity for calculating the ECS in \texttt{ClustAssess} is $O(nm)$, where $n$ and $m$ represent the number of clusters of both partitions.
        

    \item As the number of clusters increases, the \texttt{ClustAssess} package will require more time and space to calculate the ECS.

    \item \texttt{Clusim} calculates the whole affinity matrix, so its performance is not influenced by the number of clusters.

\subsection{Stability pipeline benchmarks}

\begin{frame}{How the stability pipeline will be benchmarked}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item We evaluated the performance of the five independent components: \texttt{feature\_stability}, \texttt{nn\_n\_conn\_comps}, \texttt{nn\_importance}, \texttt{clustering\_importance}, \texttt{resolution\_importance}.
        \item The stability pipeline was evaluated on the \textit{Mende et al} data \cite{Mende2022} with subsamples ranging from 1000 to 13000 cells.
        \item The pipeline allows support for parallelisation, i.e. we measured the pipeline's performance by varying the number of cores.
        \item We also evaluated the impact of using different ECS threshold values: 1, 0.99 and 0.95.
    \end{itemize}

On the X-axis we represent different number of cores. The Y-axis contains the runtime (in minutes). The colour indicates the size of the dataset.} %We observe no performance gain when ECS threshold is lowered. \texttt{nn\_n\_conn\_comps} has the best scaling when increasing the dataset, followed by \texttt{resolution\_importance}. Adding more cores generally brings a performance boost, with some exceptions related to the overhead created by either the small size of the dataset or the ratio between the number of runs and the number of cores. }
