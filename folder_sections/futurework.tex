\section{Limitation and Future work}

\begin{frame}{Limitation and Future work}
Limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our analysis was performed on data processed using only two sequencing techniques, SMART seq and 10x.
    \item The results were obtained on relatively small datasets with up to 13000 cells.
    \item The benchmarks were performed only on crisp partitions.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Further improvement of the ECS calculation.
    \item Optimization of ECS calculation for the overlapping and hierarchical cases.
    \item Test the scalability of the stability pipeline on bigger datasets.
    \item Optimization of the merging of almost identical partitions.
    \item Finding a correlation between the maximum number of disagreements and the ECS value.
\end{itemize}
